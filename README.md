## ALPHA STAGE ##
## This add-on will force install Wand through PIP at the moment. ##

An extension made to be export textures in GPU ready formats.
Used in conjunction with the VRChat GLB Loader I'm currently making.

Since I couldn't use PNG/JPEG formats in VRChat (no conversion methods
available at runtime), I made an extension to export textures in GPU
ready formats.

At the moment only DXT5 is supported using Wand.
